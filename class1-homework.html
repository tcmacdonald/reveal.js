          <h3>Task #1: Fun With Strings</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.</li>
            <li>Output the following sentence to the console like so: <strong>"You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <hr>

          <h3>Task #2: Fun with Numbers</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Write a function called <code>square_number</code> that will take one argument (a number), square that number, and return the result. It should also log a string like <strong>"The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."</strong></li>
            <li>Write a function called <code>half_number</code> that will take one argument (a number), divide it by 2, and return the result. It should also log a string like <strong>"Half of 5 is 2.5."</strong>.</li>
            <li>Write a function called <code>percent_of</code> that will take two numbers, figure out what percent the first number represents of the second number, and return the result. It should also log a string like <strong>"2 is 50% of 4."</strong></li>
            <li>Write a function called <code>area_of_circle</code> that will take one argument (the radius), calculate the area based on that, and return the result. It should also log a string like <strong>"The area for a circle with radius 2 is 12.566370614359172."</strong></li>
            <li><i>Bonus: Round the result so there are only two digits after the decimal.</i></li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Task #3: The Calculator</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Write a function <code>calculate</code> that will take one argument (a number) and perform the following operations, using the functions you wrote earlier...</li>
            <li>Take half of the number and store the result.</li>
            <li>Square the result of #1 and store that result.</li>
            <li>Calculate the area of a circle with the result of #2 as the radius.</li>
            <li>Calculate what percentage that area is of the squared result (#3).</li>
